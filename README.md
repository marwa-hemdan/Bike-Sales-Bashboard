# Bike-Sales-Bashboard
This Excel file, available on GitHub, is designed to demonstrate a complete workflow of data analysis, starting from raw data cleaning to creating interactive dashboards. The file includes the following key components:

1. Raw Data Table
The original dataset is stored in a clearly labeled sheet

It contains unstructured or semi-structured data such as sales, customer info, and bike purchase.

Common issues like  inconsistent formatting, and missing values are present and intended for cleaning.

2. Cleaned Data Table
A cleaned version of the dataset is created in a separate sheet.

Cleaning steps include:

Removing duplicates

Filling or removing blank cells

Converting data types ( number to currency)

Standardizing values (Material statuse labels)

3. Pivot Tables
Multiple pivot tables are created to summarize and analyze key metrics.

Examples include:

Total sales by region

Sales trends by ages  

Top-performing bike 

These pivot tables are located on dedicated sheets (average income per purshase, customer age brackets, customer commute).

4. Interactive Dashboard
A visual dashboard is built using Excel charts (bar, line, pie, etc.) linked to pivot tables.

It includes KPIs, summary charts, and visual trends.

The dashboard is user-friendly and visually structured for quick insights.

5. Slicers
Slicers are added to enhance interactivity.

Users can filter data in real-time based on:

material status 

Region 

Education


This makes the dashboard dynamic and suitable for multiple levels of analysis.
