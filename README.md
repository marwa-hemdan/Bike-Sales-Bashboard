## 🗂️ Key Components

### 1. **Raw Data Table**

* Found on a dedicated sheet labeled accordingly.
* Contains unstructured or semi-structured data such as:

  * Customer demographics
  * Sales information
  * Bike purchase records
* Intentionally includes common data issues like inconsistent formatting and missing values to simulate a real-world dataset.

---

### 2. **Cleaned Data Table**

* Located on a separate sheet after cleaning.
* Cleaning steps performed include:

  * Removing duplicates
  * Handling blank or missing cells
  * Converting data types (e.g., numbers to currency format)
  * Standardizing categorical labels (e.g., material status)

---

### 3. **Pivot Tables**

* Several pivot tables are created to analyze core metrics and segment data:

  * Total sales by region
  * Sales trends by age groups
  * Top-performing bike models
  * Average income per purchase
  * Customer commute distances and age brackets
* Each pivot table is organized on its own sheet for clarity and easy access.

---

### 4. **Interactive Dashboard**

* Built using Excel’s charting tools (bar, line, pie charts, etc.)
* Fully interactive and linked to the pivot tables for dynamic updates
* Features include:

  * KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)
  * Visual summaries and trend analysis
  * A clean, professional layout for quick insights

---

### 5. **Slicers for Interactivity**

* Slicers are used to allow real-time filtering of data within the dashboard.
* Users can filter views based on:

  * Material status
  * Region
  * Education level
* These controls make the dashboard dynamic and adaptable for multi-level analysis.
